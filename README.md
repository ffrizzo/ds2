# DS2 Library
*	Made to simplyfy the communication between arduino code and ECUs using DS2 k-line protocol ISO 9141.
	It was made and tested for L9637D but any interface should work the same way. 

*	Look at [example](examples/BasicExample/BasicExample.ino) and drop ['libraries'](examples/BasicExample/) folder into your library location.

*	More info about the project on [RomRaider Forum](https://www.romraider.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=58&t=17030) <==
*	and [MS4X.net wiki](https://www.ms4x.net/index.php?title=Logger.S) <==


## Protocol DS2
*	Echo - if you send any command on DS2 it responds with whatever was send due to way K-line is like constructed.
*	Imagine K-line being a single guitar string and our TX is making it vibrate and our RX is constantly picking up this vibrations. This is echo
	
*	1st byte in command/response is device which should receive command or which send the command
	0x12 - ECU default

*	2nd byte is command/response length

*	3rd byte for response it's acknowledge byte A0 meaning positive response, B0 being negative and any other (usually FF) being error; for command is specific to command itself.
	
*	4th - Xth bytes are for payload

*	Last byte is always XOR checksum. You can use this calculator to get it: https://www.scadacore.com/tools/programming-calculators/online-checksum-calculator/

*	Some commands for DS2 for BMW including MS41 / MS41.1 / MS41.2 / MS41.3 / MS42 / MS43:
	-	ECU id - {0x12, 0x04, 0x00, 0x16}
	-	General values - {0x12, 0x05, 0x0B, 0x03, 0x1F}
